# ALDA Algorithm Analysis 1
Analyzing sorting algorithms using Big-O Notation. 

## About this repository 

This mini project chooses and analyses 5 sorting algorithms using graphs generated by python libraries and tests coverages. The idea is to identify which is the best sorting algorithm and understanding why.

In here we will take a look also at different coding components such as algorithms, constants, data generators and execution time gathering.
