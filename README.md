# ALDA Algorithm Analysis 1
Analyzing sorting algorithms using Big-O Notation. 

## About this repository 

This mini project chooses and analyses 5 sorting algorithms using graphs generated by python libraries and tests coverages. The idea is to identify which is the best sorting algorithm and understanding why.

In here we will take a look also at different coding components such as algorithms, constants, data generators and execution time gathering. 

You will find a src file that contains the main modules, including the sorting algorithms chosen (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort), the random generator of data and more. 

In order to compare all the sorting techniques at the same time, only 1 graph is displayed for all the running times of the algorithms.
